Ed is the standard text editor.

Cygwin has /bin/ed, but it requires the cygwin dll.
There's another ed for windows at http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/ed.htm,
but it requires a regex dll.

Ok, only joking.

I'm about to try github (bitbucket? gitorious?) and I was looking for a test project.
Plus I'm a linux/bsd guy, so porting to mingw makes it not completely boring.

Re the choice of which ed:
- The GNU page says it's superseded by GNU emacs and GNU moe.
- The BSD... wait, which BSD?
- Plan9port is utf8 capable, actively maintained, and I'm already
  keeping it up to date on all my computers.

The only significant difference wrt all other implementations is
the way regular expressions work: p9p uses plan9's regexp(7),
which is "the form used by egrep(1) before egrep got complicated".
